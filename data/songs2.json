            "infoText": "Silent Hill is one of the most iconic entries in the survival horror genre. Like Resident Evil, Silent Hill uses fixed camera angles and tank controls to give the player a feeling of unease and a carefully calculated suspense. However, Silent Hill uses the town against the player to create a nightmare setting and a lack of control in the game’s reality. Silent Hill follows Harry Mason who searches the town to find his daughter after a car crash leaves them stranded. With his daughter nowhere to be found, Harry must delve into the heart of the town of Silent Hill to discover the ancient secrets hidden there."
